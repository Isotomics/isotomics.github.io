              <h2>About Isotomics</h2>
	      <p>Isotomics develops and uses cutting-edge analytical techniques to understand the patterns of abundance and distribution of isotopes in natural molecules. These measurements have application in a variety of fields, including biomedicine, chemical synthesis, forensics and petroleum exploration.</p>
	      <p>Our founding application is to measure the amount of excess 13C-2H “clumps” — two rare isotopes in the same molecule — in methane. This clumping, or nonrandom distribution, varies as a function of the temperature at which the molecule formed and equilibrated.</p>
